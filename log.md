# 100 days of code challenge
### Day 0(January 13, 2018)

#####Today's progress
 - read and practiced to the chapter 5 of "Learn python the hard way" 
 - I forgot quotations a few times(I need to remember that they're strings)
 
#####Thoughts
 - the author said "Do not use IDEs" but I can use my laptop only at night and would rather code than read mangas at noon so I practiced with Pythonista on my phone. I also redid the lessons with Atom later on my laptop.
 - I think my speed is too slow. There won't be any project links since all I did is simple maths and typing print("...") for quite a number times.
