# 100 days of code challenge
### Day 1(January 13, 2018)
#### Progress
 - read and practiced to the chapter 5 of "Learn python the hard way" so about strings and variables
 - I forgot quotations a few times(I need to remember that they're strings)
 
#### Thoughts
 - the author said "Do not use IDEs" but I can use my laptop only at night and would rather code than read mangas at noon so I practiced with Pythonista on my phone. I also redid the lessons with Atom later on my laptop.
 - I think my learning speed is too slow. There won't be any project links since all I did is simple maths and typing print("...") for quite a number times. 

### Day 2(January 14, 2018)
#### Progress
- mainly learnt about formatting, inputs, len(), str(), int(), float() and more about variables. I now understand clearer than yesterday. Completed "Learn python the hard way"'s sample lessons and don't have a credit card to buy the whole book so I'm now learning with "Automate the boring stuff with python"

#### Thoughts
- I still think my learning speed is quite slow. I still don't think I can do any project with this limited knowledge either.

### Day 3(January 15, 2018)
#### Progress
- learnt about Boolean values and Boolean operators. I was typing "Bootlean"s in my comments instead of "Boolean" until I was about to update my progress. :') Glad I noticed it quick though.

#### Thoughts
- didn't learn much today since I was absorbed in a book. :( Read is read but must not go overboard and stay productive.

### Day 4(January 16, 2018)
#### Progress
- ‪learnt about control flow statements(not all yet, just some of them). Took a little bit of time to understand “while” statement but I get it now.‬

#### Thoughts
- I need to invest more of my time learning Python.
